# Nswag sample

A little sample setup to generate C# clients/controllers from a local OpenApi spec. Mainly here because I keep forgetting how to use NSwag :)

# Interesting files

- `openapi.json` - The local OpenApi spec
- `nswag.json` - Configuration on what and how to generate from what for the nswag module

# No License

This is such a small sample so there is no license.
